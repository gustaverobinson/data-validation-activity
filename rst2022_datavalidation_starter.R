# The following code is used to validate your data and identify issues with the data that must     #
# be addressed. Keep in mind that every script you use to validate data you receive will vary      #
# depending on the specifics of that dataset. Be critical and careful in what issues may arise as  #
# you look at the data and documentation you receive from a provider. This code will produce a log #
# that will highlight the issues this data has in red. It will not break when there is an issue    #
# with the data.                                                                                   #
